Ride Sharing Data Analysis

## **Overview of PyBer Analysis**
This project was designed to analyze PyBer's ride sharing data and provide meaningful insight about how Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities compare in regards to total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and weekly average fares by city type.


## **Results of PyBer Analysis**

#### Ride Sharing Analysis by City Type
The analysis of the PyBer ride sharing data commenced with stratifying the data based on city type. Thecity type categories were Urban, Rural, and Suburban. The analysis focuses on the discrepancies between city types in regards to total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The outcome depicts that there was a total of 2375 rides across all city types. Urban cities accounted for 1625 rides (68.4% of the total rides), whille there were 625 (26%) and 125 (5%) rides for Suburban and Rural cities respectively. The results for the number of drivers per city type depicted that there Urban cities account for the 2405 drivers (80.9% of drivers), while suburban and rural cities accounted for 490 (16.5%) and 78 (2.6%) drivers respectively. The next factor of interest was the total fares which aounted to $63,838.64 across all cities. Urban, Suburban , and Rural cites accrued $39,854.38 (62.7%), $19,356.33 (30.5), and $4,327.93 (6%) respectively. The previous three outcomes are largely attributed to the populations of the respective city types. The following factor that was observed was the average fare per ride. Contrary to the the previous three factors Urban cities recorded the lowest average fare per ride $24.53, while Suburban and Rural cities recorded $30.97, and $34.62 respectively. Finally, the average fare per driver for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities was recorded to be $16.57, $39.50, and $55.49 respectively.

#### Total Weekly Fares for each City Type
The following portion of the analysis was focused on the total weekly fares by each city type for the period between 2019-01-01 and 2019-04-28. In spite of recording the lowest average fare per ride, Urban cities still managed to accrue the highest weekly fares acroos all weeks included in the period of interest. Simultaneously, Rural cities accumulated the the lowest weekly fares. The outcome was depicted in the multi-line chart attached bellow.

## **Summary**
In conclusion the outcome of this analysis have led to several inferences, which manifested into the three business recommendations. The first two recommendations are designed to grow PyBer's market cap in Rural and Suburban cities. The first recommendation revolvs around beginning a marketing campaign to grow PyBer's reach and market share within Rural and Suburban cities. The second recommendation suggests establishing an incentivize program focused at increasing the number of drivers in rural cities to help decrease the average fare per ride and in doing so make the service cheaper and more appealing for users. Finally the last recommendation is a program that would incentivize users in Rural and Suburban cities to recommend the service to those they know.
